<p>I picked up a bicycle flashing light for $5.  It runs off of two AA batteries, and has a single switch to operate the mode of the flasher (off, cycling, flashing, all on).  I have built a shifter project and controlled 16 LEDs, This will save me code and circuitry yielding the same result.</p>
<p>Once I tore it down and got a meter on it, I found that one side of the single switch just needed to pulled to ground to toggle the mode of the flasher.  From there it was pretty easy.  I added a 20K ohm resister in series with arduino's 3.3v out to the power inputs of the tiny board.  I connected the side of the switch that wants ground to toggle to digital output 3.  Just to be safe I put a diode and a 10k ohm resister between the devices switch and the arduino.</p>
<p>&lt;insert fritzing here, as soon as I figure out how to make a new part&gt;</p>
<p>The sketch is pretty simple.  My purpose was to simply control the light so I can use it in another project.  I would like to figure out how to determine the state of the flasher from code,  I imagine I could measure current draw... for another day</p>
[C++]
uint8_t BIKE_LIGHT_PIN = 3;

void setup() {
	Serial.begin(9600);
	Serial.println("Hello BikeLight");
	pinMode(BIKE_LIGHT_PIN, OUTPUT);
}

String state[] = {"Off.", "cycling.", "flashing.","all on."};

int lightState = 0;

void toggleLightSwitch(){
 digitalWrite(BIKE_LIGHT_PIN, LOW); // when goes to ground, toggles mode
 delay(150);
 digitalWrite(BIKE_LIGHT_PIN, HIGH);  //protected by a diode
 lightState++;
 Serial.print("Lights are "); Serial.println(state[lightState %4]);
}

void loop() {
	toggleLightSwitch();
	delay(10000);
}
[/C++]
<p>PS: My only bread board has another project on it, hence the clip leads.</p>
